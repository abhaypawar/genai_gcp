# 🚀 Everything About PROMPTS and PROMPT ENGINEERING in 2025 (Nerdified)

---

# 1. 🎯 What is a Prompt?

**Prompt** = The **input** you provide to a Generative AI model (like GPT, Claude, Gemini)  
to **guide** it in producing the **desired output**.

> **Prompt = Question + Context + Instruction + Constraints + Style guidance**

---

# 2. 🧠 Why Prompts Are Critical?

- AI doesn't "think" or "understand" like humans.
- The **better you frame the prompt**, the better the **model output**.
- Prompt = Primary tool to **control**, **steer**, **extract quality** from LLMs.

# 3. 📈 Evolution of Prompting (till 2025)

| Year | Advancement |
|:-----|:------------|
| 2020 | Simple questions ("What's the capital of France?") |
| 2021 | Zero-shot prompting, Chain-of-Thought prompting introduced |
| 2022 | Few-shot learning, Instruction tuning (InstructGPT) |
| 2023 | Prompt engineering becomes a real job role! |
| 2024 | Multi-modal prompting (text + image + audio) |
| 2025 | Function-calling prompts, autonomous agents (AutoGPT, BabyAGI), tool-augmented prompts |

---

# 4. 🛠️ Types of Prompting Techniques

## 4.1 Zero-Shot Prompting
- Ask a question directly **without giving examples**.
  
```text
"Translate the sentence 'I love cats' into French."
```

## 4.2 One-Shot Prompting
- Give **one example** before the main task.

```text
"Example: English: Hello ➔ French: Bonjour
Now, English: Good night ➔ "
```

## 4.3 Few-Shot Prompting
- Provide **few examples** to **teach** model the pattern.

```text
"Translate:
English: Thank you ➔ French: Merci
English: How are you? ➔ French: Comment ça va?
English: See you soon ➔ "
```

## 4.4 Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)
- Force the model to **show step-by-step reasoning**.

```text
"Q: If there are 3 red balls and 2 blue balls, how many balls in total?
A: First, there are 3 red balls. Then 2 blue balls. 3 + 2 = 5. Final answer: 5"
```

## 4.5 Self-Consistency Prompting
- Generate **multiple solutions** and pick the most consistent answer.

## 4.6 Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting
- Instead of linear reasoning, **explore multiple reasoning paths** like a tree.

## 4.7 ReAct Prompting (Reasoning + Acting)
- Combine **reasoning** and **tool usage** (like browsing, calculations) in prompts.

# 5. 🛠️ Special Prompt Types in 2025

| Prompt Type | Usage |
|:------------|:------|
| **Instruction Prompt** | "Summarize this paragraph in 5 points." |
| **Multi-turn Prompt** | Continual conversation where context is retained. |
| **Multimodal Prompt** | Text + Image + Audio mixed prompts (like Gemini 1.5, GPT-4V). |
| **Tool-augmented Prompt** | Use API calls, databases via function-calling prompts. |
| **Agentic Prompt** | Autonomous loops: LLM deciding, planning, executing (AutoGPT style). |

---

# 6. 🔥 What is Prompt Engineering?

> **Prompt Engineering = Designing, refining, optimizing prompts to maximize model performance.**

---

# 7. 🎯 Prompt Engineering Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Explicit instructions** | "Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'." |
| **Role prompting** | "You are an expert lawyer. Give legal advice." |

# 8. 🧠 Advanced Prompting Ideas (2025 Level)

## 8.1 Few-Shot + CoT + Tool Usage Prompt

Mix styles for SUPERIOR results.

```text
You are a medical assistant.
Given a symptom description, first:
1. List possible diagnoses.
2. For each, suggest an initial test.
3. Query a medical database via function_call.

Example:
[...Few shots here...]

Input: "Patient complains about chest pain and shortness of breath."
```

---

## 8.2 Meta-Prompting

Prompt the model **to create better prompts** for itself!

```text
"Given the task of summarizing scientific articles, design the most effective prompt."
```

---

## 8.3 System Prompts vs User Prompts

- **System prompt** = Hidden message at conversation start ("You are ChatGPT, helpful assistant.")
- **User prompt** = Actual user input.

In 2025, **dynamic system prompts** are being heavily researched.

---

# 9. 📦 Common Mistakes in Prompting

- Being **too vague** ("Explain this" ➔ about what?)
- Mixing **multiple tasks** without structure.
- Assuming AI has **real-world memory** or **facts**.
- Forgetting about **output format control**.

---

# 10. ⚡ Prompt Patterns Used Widely

| Pattern | Example |
|:--------|:--------|
| **Question-Answer** | "Q: Who is the CEO of OpenAI?" |
| **Instructional** | "Write a cover letter for a product manager." |
| **Dialogue Simulation** | "You are Elon Musk. Debate with Einstein." |
| **Step-by-Step Reasoning** | "Explain your thinking before answering." |
| **Critique and Improve** | "Critique the following paragraph and rewrite it better." |

---

# 🚀 Deep Dive into Advanced Prompt Techniques (2025 Nerdified)

---

# 1. 🛠️ Function Calling in LLMs

## 📖 What is it?

- Instead of generating raw text, the LLM **calls predefined functions** based on your prompt.
- Model **decides** **which function** to call + **what arguments** to pass.

## 📦 Why Needed?

- Integrates LLMs with **real APIs**, **databases**, **calculators**, etc.
- Makes models **actionable** instead of just "chatty".

## 🔥 Example

```json
{
  "function": "get_weather",
  "arguments": {
    "city": "Paris",
    "unit": "celsius"
  }
}
```

**Prompt Example:**

```text
"What is the current weather in Paris in Celsius?"
```
- Model **doesn't** hallucinate.
- It **calls** `get_weather(city="Paris", unit="celsius")` ➔ API returns real data ➔ LLM formats answer.

---

# 2. 🛠️ RAG Pipelines with Prompt Templates (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## 📖 What is it?

- **RAG** = Before generating, **retrieve relevant external information** from knowledge bases.
- Then **inject** that knowledge into the prompt ➔ LLM generates answer using updated knowledge.

## 🔥 Why Important?

- LLMs have **limited memory** and **knowledge cutoff**.
- RAG **fixes hallucination** by **grounding outputs** with real-time data.

## 🛠️ Basic Flow

```text
User Query ➔ Retrieve top-5 documents ➔ Insert into a prompt ➔ LLM generates final answer.
```

## 📜 Prompt Template Example

```text
Context:
{retrieved_documents}

Question:
{user_query}

Answer:
```

**Tools used:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, etc.

---

# 3. 🛠️ Multi-modal Prompt Chaining

## 📖 What is it?

- Creating chains of prompts that deal with **different data types** — text, image, audio, video.

## 🌟 Real Example

Task: "Describe the image and summarize the description into a tweet."

### Chain
1. **First Prompt:** Analyze Image ➔ Caption Generator
2. **Second Prompt:** Summarize Caption ➔ Tweet Generator

---

# 4. 🛠️ Self-Healing Prompts

## 📖 What is it?

- Techniques where LLM **detects**, **corrects**, and **retries** when it makes a mistake or gets an unexpected result.

## 🔥 How it works?

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Generate initial response. |
| 2 | Critique/check its own output. |
| 3 | If issue found, refine prompt and regenerate. |

### Example

```text
Task: "Return the list in JSON format."
```
- If model outputs invalid JSON ➔ prompt itself tells model to retry with stricter format.

---

# 5. 🛠️ Agents Orchestration Prompts

## 📖 What is it?

- Designing prompts to **coordinate multiple LLMs (agents)** working together on complex tasks.

## 🧠 Each agent has:

- Specific **roles**.
- Specialized **skills**.
- **Shared memory** or **messaging** between them.

## 🔥 Real Example

Task: **Build a research report**

| Agent | Role |
|:------|:-----|
| Researcher Agent | Finds sources. |
| Summarizer Agent | Summarizes sources. |
| Writer Agent | Compiles report in beautiful English. |
| QA Agent | Proofreads for grammar/style issues. |

Each agent uses **different prompting instructions**, orchestrated via a **manager agent**.

---

# 📚 Full Summary (Ultra-Quick)

| Concept | Core Idea |
|:--------|:----------|
| **Function Calling** | Model calls APIs/tools dynamically, not just chat. |
| **RAG Pipelines** | Fetch fresh data ➔ inject into prompt ➔ reduce hallucination. |
| **Multi-modal Chaining** | Sequential prompts for text+image+audio combined tasks. |
| **Self-Healing Prompts** | Model critiques and improves its own outputs automatically. |
| **Agentic Orchestration** | Team of LLMs with specialized roles collaborate via prompts. |
